# Developing-an-Explainable-AI-Model-for-Predicting-Cardiovascular-Disease-Risk-in-Patients

Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is one of the major health challenges accounting for 17.9 million deaths worldwide. And Out of all these unfortunate deaths 90% of which are preventable. Predicting the risk of CVD in patients early can save millions of life. In this study, we have considered the limitations reported in previous research regarding the generalization of findings to other cohorts, age ranges, and the presence of missing predictors. To overcome these limitations, our work concentrates on optimizing predictors, tackling the black-box nature of the model, and incorporating data shift and external validation. For our study, we are using a Cardiovascular Disease dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains different physical, behavioral features and the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease. The target variable has binary values like 0 and 1, making it suitable for classical classification methods. For that, we implemented predictive models using SVM, Decision tree, Random forests, and Knn and Xgboost and we found that Random Forest performed really well in predicting CVD risk in our use case with 73% Accuracy then we use three different explainable approaches in order to explain the results of our predictive models using LIME and SHAP and SHAPASH And we found that High Blood pressure and Age are the top 2 most influential risk factors
